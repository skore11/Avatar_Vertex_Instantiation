# Avatar_Vertex_Instantiation
In this project, the aim is to Instantiate vertices as game objects when they are on a skinned mesh renderer, the extension to the same is to allow for the instantiated vertices to be part of mass spring system whose properties are dictated by a compute shader. As of now the vertex instantiation works, each vertex is a gameobject independantly. However the ability to skin using objects part of the compute shader is still not implemented. Pls Refer to Demo_withAvatar_InstantiatetrialsV1, turn on InstantiateVert2.js to view voxelized Avatar during run time on the CPU.
